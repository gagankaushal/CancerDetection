# CancerDetection
The project leverages both image and non-image data to make predictions for the cancer patients

1. Non-Image Data (Linear Regression model) <br/>
One of the two main goals of the project was to assist doctors in diagnosing the cancer in patients by analyzing histopathological images.<br/> 
In line with this, image data was leveraged and two CNN models were implemented and studied, based on AlexNet and ResNet-50. <br/>
The models were able to classify images into malignant and benign with an accuracy of 92.1% and 98.6% respectively.<br/>


2. Image Data(Convolutional Neural Network)<br/>
Second goal was to leverage non image data and provide supplemental information to the doctors and colon cancer patients. <br/>
For this, a linear regression model was developed that predicts following based on past data for years 1975 to 2011:<br/>
a) 5-year survival rate and <br/>
b) Recurrence rate of colon cancer<br/>
